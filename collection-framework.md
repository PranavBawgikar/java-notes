## Collection in Java
A collection is a group of individual data, that are grouped together to form a single unit.
For example, if we store the names of all the employees in a single list and name it as Employee, it will form a collection.

The two root interfaces of Java Collection class are:
- Collection interface (`java.util.Collection`)
- Map interface (`java.util.Map`)

### Collection framework in Java
Collection framework is a combination of classes and interfaces. All collection frameworks in Java include the following three elements:
1.	Interfaces
3.	Implementation or classes
4.	Collection Algorithms

The root of the Collection framework interface is  `java.util.Collection`. It consists of several important methods which includes `add()`, `size()`, `remove()`, etc.

##### Map Interface
The only interface that does not implement the collection interface but is part of the framework is the Map interface. It is used to map the data in the form of keys and values.
